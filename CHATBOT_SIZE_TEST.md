# âœ… ChatBot Size Fix - 50% x 95%

## ðŸ”§ **Fixed the Issue:**

The problem was that the React component was using the CSS class `chatbot-window-normal`, but Tailwind's inline classes have higher specificity and were overriding it.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Direct Tailwind Classes Now Applied:**

```tsx
// Normal mode classes:
'w-[50vw] h-[95vh] min-w-[400px] min-h-[600px] max-w-[800px]'

// Responsive:
'md:w-[60vw] md:h-[90vh]'           // Tablets: 60% x 90%
'sm:w-[95vw] sm:h-[90vh]'           // Mobile: 95% x 90%
```

## ðŸ“± **Expected Results:**

### **Desktop:**
- Width: 50% of viewport (e.g., 960px on 1920px screen)
- Height: 95% of viewport (e.g., 1026px on 1080px screen)
- Position: Top-right with small margin

### **Tablet:**
- Width: 60% of viewport
- Height: 90% of viewport
- More prominent on medium screens

### **Mobile:**
- Width: 95% of viewport
- Height: 90% of viewport  
- Nearly fullscreen with small margins

## ðŸš€ **To Test:**

1. Save the ChatBot.tsx file with the new changes
2. Restart your development server if needed
3. Click the blue floating chat button
4. The window should now be **much larger** - 50% width and 95% height!

## ðŸŽ‰ **What You Should See:**

- **Large Window**: Takes up half your screen width and almost full height
- **Professional Look**: Perfect for medical consultations
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Still Functional**: Fullscreen button (â›¶) works for even more space

The chatbot window should now be significantly larger than before!
