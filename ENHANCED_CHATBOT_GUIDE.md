## 📱 Frontend Implementation

### Step 1: Add the ChatBot Component

Add this to your main App component or wherever you want the chatbot:

```tsx
// In your App.tsx or main component
import React from 'react';
import ChatBot from './components/ChatBot';
import './components/ChatBot/ChatBot.css'; // Import styles

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* Your existing content */}
      
      {/* Add ChatBot - it will appear as floating button */}
      <ChatBot />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 2: Ensure Required Dependencies

Make sure these are in your package.json (they should already be):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@radix-ui/react-avatar": "^1.1.10",
    "@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.14",
    "@radix-ui/react-scroll-area": "^1.2.9",
    "framer-motion": "^11.18.2",
    "lucide-react": "^0.462.0"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update Your Backend URLs

In the ChatBot component, make sure the API URLs match your backend:

```tsx
// In ChatBot.tsx, update these URLs if needed:
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/ai/chat', {
  // ... for text chat

const response = await fetch('/api/v1/ai/detect-condition', {
  // ... for image analysis
```

## 🎨 UI Features

- Blue gradient background with hover effects
- Scales slightly on hover for better UX

### **Fullscreen Toggle**
- Located in chat header (top-right corner)
- **Maximize2** icon when in normal view
- **Minimize2** icon when in fullscreen
- Smooth transition between states

### **Structured Message Display**

- Clear sections with emoji headings
- Bullet points and numbered lists

### **Image Upload Interface**

## 🔧 Response Structure Examples

### **Before (Paragraph Format):**
```
I understand you're dealing with a headache. Here are some general tips that might help: Stay hydrated, rest in a dark room, apply cold compress. If your headache is severe or comes with fever, neck stiffness, or vision changes, please seek medical attention. On a scale of 1-10, how severe is your headache?
```

### **After (Structured Point-wise Format):**
```
🩺 I understand you're dealing with a headache - I'm here to help!

🏠 IMMEDIATE RELIEF STEPS:
1. 💧 Drink water - Dehydration is a common headache trigger
2. 😴 Rest in quiet, dark room - Light and noise can worsen headaches  
3. ❄️ Apply cold compress - Place on forehead or back of neck
4. 🌿 Practice deep breathing - Helps relax and reduce tension

⚠️ SEEK MEDICAL CARE IF:
• Headache is severe (8/10 or higher)
• Accompanied by fever, stiff neck, or vision changes
• Sudden, severe headache unlike any before
• Persists despite rest and hydration

💬 TO HELP YOU BETTER:

On a scale of 1-10, how severe is your headache right now?
(1 = barely noticeable, 10 = worst pain imaginable)
```

## 🔬 Medical Image Analysis

### **How It Works:**
1. User clicks camera icon
2. Selects medical image from device
3. Optionally describes symptoms
4. AI analyzes image and provides structured response

### **Analysis Format:**
```
🔬 WHAT I SEE:
• Red, circular, raised patch on skin
• Well-defined borders with scaling
• Appears inflamed compared to surrounding skin

🩺 POSSIBLE CONDITIONS:
• Fungal infection (Ringworm) - Circular shape with raised borders
• Contact dermatitis - Could be allergic reaction
• Eczema patch - Though less likely given presentation

⚠️ URGENCY LEVEL: ROUTINE
Schedule appointment with dermatologist within the next week

🏠 IMMEDIATE STEPS:
1. Keep area clean and dry
2. Avoid scratching or rubbing
3. Don't share personal items
4. Consider OTC antifungal cream

👀 WATCH FOR:
• Rapid spreading to other areas
• Development of fever
• Pus or unusual discharge

💬 QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DOCTOR:
• "Could this be a fungal infection?"
• "What tests can confirm the diagnosis?"
• "How can I prevent recurrence?"
```

## 📱 Mobile Experience

### **Responsive Features:**
- Smaller floating button on mobile
- Touch-friendly interface
- Swipe gestures supported
- Camera integration for photo capture
- Optimized text size and spacing

### **Camera Capture:**
```tsx
// Mobile camera capture
<input 
  type="file" 
  accept="image/*" 
  capture="environment"  // Use back camera
  onChange={handleImageUpload}
/>
```

## 🎛️ Customization Options

### **Colors and Theming:**
```css
/* Customize in ChatBot.css */
.chatbot-section-header {
  color: #1e40af; /* Change heading color */
}

.chatbot-urgency-urgent {
  background: #fecaca; /* Customize urgency colors */
  border-left: 4px solid #ef4444;
}
```

### **Button Positioning:**
```tsx
// Move floating button position
<motion.div className="fixed bottom-4 left-4 z-50"> // Left side instead
```

### **Default Language:**
```tsx
// Change default language in API calls
body: JSON.stringify({
  message: inputMessage,
  language: 'ta', // Tamil instead of English
  conversationHistory
})
```
