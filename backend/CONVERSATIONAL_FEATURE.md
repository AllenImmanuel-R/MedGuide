# 🤖 Conversational Questioning Feature

## Overview
Your MedGuide AI chatbot now uses an intelligent conversational approach that asks targeted follow-up questions to better understand user health concerns, rather than overwhelming them with multiple questions at once.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **One Question at a Time**
- The AI asks **ONE specific, relevant question** per response
- Builds understanding gradually through natural conversation
- Avoids overwhelming users with multiple questions

### 2. **Smart Question Flow**
The AI follows logical conversation patterns for different health concerns:

#### **Headache Flow:**
1. Initial comfort + immediate tips
2. Severity (1-10 scale)
3. Location (one side, both sides, all over)
4. Duration (how long)
5. Associated symptoms (nausea, vision changes, etc.)

#### **Stomach Pain Flow:**
1. Comfort tips + empathy
2. Location (upper, lower, all over)
3. Type of pain (sharp, dull, cramping)
4. When it started
5. Food triggers or recent meals

#### **Fever Flow:**
1. Rest advice + hydration
2. Temperature check (thermometer reading)
3. Other symptoms (chills, aches, etc.)
4. Duration
5. Recent travel or exposure

### 3. **Immediate Comfort First**
- Always provides immediate helpful suggestions
- Offers comfort and empathy before asking questions
- Gives practical self-care tips when appropriate

## 📋 Example Conversations

### Headache Example:
```
User: "I have a headache"

AI: "I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with a headache. Here are some immediate relief tips:
💧 Drink water - dehydration often causes headaches
😴 Rest in a quiet, dark room if possible
❄️ Apply a cold compress to your forehead

On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your headache right now?"

User: "About a 7"

AI: "That sounds quite intense, I'm sorry you're in that much pain. 
Given that level of severity, you might want to consider taking an 
over-the-counter pain reliever if safe for you to do so.

Where exactly do you feel the headache most - is it on one side of 
your head, both sides, or all over?"
```

### Stomach Pain Example:
```
User: "My stomach hurts"

AI: "I'm sorry to hear your stomach is bothering you. That can be really uncomfortable.

For immediate relief, you might try:
🌿 Sipping on some warm ginger tea
🥤 Staying hydrated with small sips of water
😴 Resting in a comfortable position

To help me understand better, where exactly do you feel the pain - 
is it in your upper stomach, lower stomach, or all over?"
```
