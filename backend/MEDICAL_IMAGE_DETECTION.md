const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('image', imageFile);
formData.append('symptoms', 'red, itchy, and painful');
formData.append('language', 'en');

// Send to API
fetch('/api/v1/ai/detect-condition', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  if (data.success) {
    console.log('Analysis:', data.data.analysis);
    // Display results to user
    displayAnalysis(data.data);
  }
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### React Component Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MedicalImageAnalyzer() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState(null);
  const [symptoms, setSymptoms] = useState('');
  const [analysis, setAnalysis] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const analyzeImage = async () => {
    if (!image) return;
    
    setLoading(true);
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('image', image);
    formData.append('symptoms', symptoms);
    formData.append('language', 'en');

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/v1/ai/detect-condition', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      setAnalysis(data.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Analysis failed:', error);
    }
    setLoading(false);
  };

  return (
    <div className="medical-analyzer">
      <h2>Medical Condition Detection</h2>
      
      <div className="upload-section">
        <input
          type="file"
          accept="image/*"
          onChange={(e) => setImage(e.target.files[0])}
        />
        <textarea
          placeholder="Describe your symptoms (optional)"
          value={symptoms}
          onChange={(e) => setSymptoms(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button onClick={analyzeImage} disabled={!image || loading}>
          {loading ? 'Analyzing...' : 'Analyze Image'}
        </button>
      </div>

      {analysis && (
        <div className="analysis-results">
          <h3>Analysis Results</h3>
          <div className="analysis-content">
            <pre>{analysis.analysis}</pre>
          </div>
          <div className="disclaimer">
            <small>{analysis.disclaimer}</small>
          </div>

### cURL Testing
```bash
# Test with image and symptoms
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/ai/detect-condition \
  -F "image=@/path/to/medical-image.jpg" \
  -F "symptoms=red and swollen for 2 days" \
  -F "language=en"

# Test with just image
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/ai/detect-condition \
  -F "image=@/path/to/skin-rash.png" \
  -F "language=en"
```

## üéØ Example Analysis Output

### Input:
- Image: Red, circular skin rash
- Symptoms: "itchy and spreading"

### Output:
```
üî¨ Visual Findings:
I can see a red, circular, raised patch on the skin with well-defined borders and some scaling around the edges. The area appears inflamed and slightly raised compared to the surrounding normal skin.

ü©∫ Possible Conditions:
1. **Fungal infection (Ringworm)** - The circular shape with raised borders and scaling is very characteristic of fungal infections
2. **Contact dermatitis** - Could be caused by an allergic reaction to something that touched the skin
3. **Eczema patch** - Though less likely given the circular presentation

‚ö†Ô∏è Urgency Level: ROUTINE
Schedule an appointment with a dermatologist or your primary care doctor within the next week for proper evaluation and treatment.

üè† Immediate Steps:
- Keep the area clean and dry
- Avoid scratching or rubbing the area
- Don't share towels, clothing, or personal items
- Consider over-the-counter antifungal cream if fungal infection is suspected

üëÄ Watch For:
- Rapid spreading to other areas
- Development of fever
- Pus or unusual discharge
- Worsening pain or swelling

üí¨ Medical Questions to Ask:
- "Could this be a fungal infection based on its appearance?"
- "What tests can confirm the diagnosis?"
- "How long should treatment take to show improvement?"
- "How can I prevent this from recurring?"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Built-in Safeguards:
- ‚úÖ **No Definitive Diagnosis:** Always provides possibilities, never definitive diagnoses
- ‚úÖ **Professional Emphasis:** Strongly recommends professional medical evaluation
- ‚úÖ **Emergency Detection:** Flags urgent conditions requiring immediate care
- ‚úÖ **Appropriate Disclaimers:** Includes medical disclaimers naturally in responses
- ‚úÖ **Context Awareness:** Considers user-reported symptoms alongside visual analysis

### Urgency Classification:
- **URGENT:** Signs of serious infection, emergency conditions ‚Üí Seek immediate medical care
- **SOON:** Moderate conditions ‚Üí See doctor within 1-2 days  
- **ROUTINE:** Minor issues ‚Üí Schedule appointment within a week
- **SELF-CARE:** Very minor conditions ‚Üí Monitor at home with care tips

## üåç Multi-language Support

The feature supports both English and Tamil:

```javascript
// English analysis
formData.append('language', 'en');

// Tamil analysis  
formData.append('language', 'ta');
```

## üîß Integration with Existing Features
