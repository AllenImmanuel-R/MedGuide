- File path validation and security checks

### Frontend Components

#### 1. ReportsService (`src/services/reportsService.ts`)
```typescript
- getReports(): Fetch user's reports
- analyzeReport(): Send report for AI analysis
- getReportsForChat(): Format reports for chat interface
```

#### 2. ReportSelector Component (`src/components/ReportSelector.tsx`)
- Interactive report selection interface
- File type icons and metadata display
- Loading states and error handling

#### 3. Enhanced ChatPage (`src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`)
- **handleReportSelection()**: Process selected reports
- Integration with attachment menu
- Session title updates for report analysis

## 🚀 How It Works

### User Workflow
1. **Upload Reports**: User uploads medical reports via the Reports page
2. **Access Chat**: User navigates to the Chat page
3. **Select Analysis**: User clicks attachment button → "Analyze Report"
4. **Choose Report**: User selects a report from the ReportSelector
5. **Get Analysis**: AI analyzes the report and provides health suggestions

### Technical Flow

    participant G as GeminiService
    participant DB as Database

    U->>C: Click "Analyze Report"
    C->>RS: Show ReportSelector
    RS->>API: Fetch user reports
    API->>DB: Query user's reports
    DB-->>RS: Return report list
    U->>RS: Select report
    RS->>C: handleReportSelection(reportId)
    C->>API: POST /ai/analyze-report
    API->>DB: Validate report ownership
    API->>G: Analyze report content
    G-->>API: Return analysis
    API-->>C: Health suggestions
    C->>U: Display AI response
```

// Analysis request  
{i18n.language === 'en' 
  ? `📋 Analyze my report: ${reportName}`
  : `📋 என் அறிக்கையை பகுப்பாய்வு செய்யுங்கள்: ${reportName}`}
```
